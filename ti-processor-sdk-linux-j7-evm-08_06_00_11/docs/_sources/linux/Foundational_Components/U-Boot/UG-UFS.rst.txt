UFS
---------------------------

Universal Flash Subsystem (UFS) devices show up as scsi devices similar
to SATA in the `previous section <Foundational_Components_U-Boot.html#sata>`__.
One additional command to initialize all ufs devices is:

::
    => ufs init
    Device at ufs@4e84000 up at:[RX, TX]: gear=[3, 3], lane[2, 2], pwr[FAST MODE, FAST MODE], rate = 2

|

Then we can go ahead with 'scsi scan' to see the attached devices:

::

    => scsi scan
    scanning bus for devices...
  Device 0: (0:0) Vendor: TOSHIBA Prod.: THGAF8G8T23BAILB Rev: 0300
            Type: Hard Disk
            Capacity: 31.9 MB = 0.0 GB (8191 x 4096)
  Device 0: (0:1) Vendor: TOSHIBA Prod.: THGAF8G8T23BAILB Rev: 0300
            Type: Hard Disk
            Capacity: 30499.9 MB = 29.7 GB (7807999 x 4096)

|

All the remaining scsi commands detailed in the
`previous section <Foundational_Components_U-Boot.html#sata>`__ are
also applicable.
