NOR
---------------------------------------

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family')

    .. note::
        Parallel NOR is not supported on J721E platform.

This section documents how to write files to the NOR device and use it
to load and then boot the Linux Kernel using a root filesystem also
found on NOR. In order for NOR to be visible to U-Boot a special build
of U-Boot is required on the supported hardware. The table below lists
builds that see NOR and in some cases also use theit for the environment
instead of the default, which typically is NAND. Finally, for simplicity
we assume the files are being loaded from an SD card. Using the network
interface (if applicable) is documented above.

Writing to NOR from U-Boot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note:

-  From the U-Boot build, the **u-boot.bin** file is the one to be
   written.
-  We load all files from an SD card in this example but they can just
   as easily be loaded via network (documented above) or other interface
   that exists.
-  At this time the NOR mtd partition map has not yet been updated to
   include an example location for the device tree.

Booting from NOR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within the default environment there is not a shortcut for booting. One
needs to pass **root=/dev/mtdblockN** where N is the number of the
rootfs partition in **bootargs**.
