.. rubric:: Introduction
   :name: introduction-linux-core-crypto

The Crypto API Driver is a set of Linux drivers that provide access to
the hardware cryptographic accelerators available on
AM335x/AM437x/AM57x/DRA7/AM65/J721E/J721S2/J784S4/AM62 devices. These drivers are
available built-in in the kernel in the current SDK release.

Following are the Hardware accelerators supported on the following
devices:

::

    * AM335X       : MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, AES, DES
    * AM437X       : MD5, SHA1, SAH224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, AES, DES, DES3DES
    * AM57x/DRA7   : AES, DES, DES3DES
    * AM65x/J721e  : AES, DES3DES, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512
    * J721S2/J784S4: AES, DES3DES, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512
    * AM64X/AM62X  : AES, SHA256, SHA512

.. rubric:: Building the Drivers
   :name: building-the-drivers

For devices with available cryptographic hardware accelerators, a Linux
driver and additionally a Cryptodev kernel module (for OpenSSL) is used
to access them.  Other devices use the pure software implementation of these
cryptographic operations.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_crypto in ('sa2ul')

    |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| SoCs support a hardware accelerator called
    Security Accelerator 2 Ultra Light (SA2UL) for crypto operations.

The kernel configuration has already been set up in the SDK and no further
configuration is needed for the drivers to be built-in to the kernel.

For reference, the configuration details are shown below. The
configuration of the cryptographic drivers is done under the
Hardware crypto devices sub-menu of the Cryptographic API menu in the
kernel configuration.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_crypto in ('sa2ul')

    .. code-block:: text

        Symbol: CRYPTO_DEV_SA2UL [=m]
          ¦ Type  : tristate
          ¦ Prompt: Support for TI security accelerator
          ¦   Location:
          ¦     -> Cryptographic API (CRYPTO [=y])
          ¦ (1)   -> Hardware crypto devices (CRYPTO_HW [=y])

    To check if sa2ul module is properly installed,
    run the below command from the Linux command prompt:

    ::

        lsmod | grep sa2ul

    Output should show something similar to below:

    ::

        sa2ul 262144 0

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_crypto in ('omap')

    .. code-block:: text

.. rubric:: Build the Cryptodev kernel module using SDK
   :name: build-the-cryptodev-kernel-module-using-sdk

For using OpenSSL to access the Crypto Hardware Accelerator Drivers
above, the Cryptodev is required (can be built as module). The framework
is not officially in the kernel and was ported to Linux under the name
"cryptodev". It is built as part of the SDK and no further configuration is needed.

.. rubric:: Using Cryptographic Hardware Accelerators from OpenSSL
   :name: using-cryptographic-hardware-accelerators-from-openssl

In order to use these drivers from OpenSSL, a
special driver is available which abstracts the access to these
accelerators through Cryprodev module.

Cryptodev is itself a special device driver which provides a general
interface for higher level applications such as OpenSSL to access
hardware accelerators.

The filesystem which comes with the SDK comes built with the Cryptodev
kernel modules and the TI driver which directly accesses the hardware
accelerators is built into the kernel.

The following shows the command used to query the system for the state of
the cryptodev module.

    ::

        root@evm:~# lsmod | grep cryptodev
        cryptodev              11962  0

The following example demonstrates the OpenSSL built-in speed
test to demonstrate performance. The addition of the parameter **-engine
devcrypto** tells OpenSSL to use the Cryptodev driver if it exists.

When the cryptodev driver is removed, OpenSSL reverts to the software
implementation of the crypto algorithm. The performance using the
software only implementation can be compared to the previous test.

Note that the results may be slightly different on your system, since,
after all, we're dealing with a random number generator. Any appreciable
number of errors typically indicates a bad random number generator.

If you're satisfied the random number generator is working correctly,
you can use **rngd** (the random number generator daemon) to feed the
/dev/random entropy pool.
