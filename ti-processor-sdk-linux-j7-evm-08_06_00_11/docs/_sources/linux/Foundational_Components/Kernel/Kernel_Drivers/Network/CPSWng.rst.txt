Introduction
""""""""""""

The TI |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| family of devices have Multi Port
Gigabit Ethernet Switch Subsystem CPSWng. SoCs may have more than 4 external
ports with selectable RGMII, QSGMII and SGMII interfaces and an internal
Communications Port Programming Interface (CPPI) port (Host port 0).
Host Port 0 CPPI Packet Streaming Interface interface supports 8 TX
channels and one RX channel DMA channel.

Multi port Gigabit Ethernet Switch Subsystem CPSWng supports both independent
MAC mode of operation supporting multiple independent Ethernet
interfaces with complete isolation (no packet switching between external
ports), or can be configured in Switch mode with IEEE 802.1Q HW bridge
in managed or learning mode between each of the individual MAC ports.

Depending on the SoC, the value of n in CPSWng varies as follows:

+-----------+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| SoC       | n in CPSWng    | Number of Ports                   |
+===========+================+===================================+
| J7200     | n = 5 (CPSW5g) | 5 (1 host port, 4 external ports) |
+-----------+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| J721e     | n = 9 (CPSW9g) | 9 (1 host port, 8 external ports) |
+-----------+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| J784S4    | n = 9 (CPSW9g) | 9 (1 host port, 8 external ports) |
+-----------+----------------+-----------------------------------+

The SDK provides support to use the CPSWng ports in two different
configurations:

#. CPSWng Virtual Client
#. CPSWng Native Ethernet Switch

.. Caution::
    The two configurations are mutually exclusive. Only one of the two
    can be enabled for a build.

.. note::
    By default, the SDK works with the CPSWng Virtual Client configuration.

CPSWng Virtual Client
"""""""""""""""""""""

In this configuration, the EthSwitch firmware running on one of the R5F cores
controls access to the CPSWng subsystem. The other cores have thin client
drivers running on them to receive data from the EthSwitch firmware. On the
A core running Linux, the virt-mac driver is responsible for the interaction
with the EthSwitch firmware.

This configuration allows multiple cores to share the CPSWng ethernet subsystem.

CPSWng Native Ethernet Switch
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In this configuration, the am65-cpsw-nuss driver in Linux, takes complete
control of the CPSWng subsystem, allowing Linux to utilize all the external
ports of the CPSWng subsystem. Linux does not share any of the network traffic
with other cores.

This configuration supports MAC mode, Switch mode and TSN features on Linux.
