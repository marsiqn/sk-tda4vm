Introduction
""""""""""""

The CPSWng ethernet subsystem can be controlled by the am65-cpsw-nuss driver in Linux to
provide standard ethernet features such as MAC mode, Switch mode, VLAN and TSN features.

.. note::
    By default, the native ethernet is configured to start in MAC mode. Switch mode can be
    enabled on demand. Refer to the "Switch Mode" section of this page for further details
    on switch mode configuration.

Driver Configuration
""""""""""""""""""""

Enable the following configs for Native Ethernet with CPSWng:

::

    CONFIG_TI_K3_AM65_CPSW_NUSS
    CONFIG_TI_K3_AM65_CPSW_SWITCHDEV
    CONFIG_TI_K3_AM65_CPTS
    CONFIG_TI_DAVINCI_MDIO
    CONFIG_TI_AM65_CPSW_TAS

    CONFIG_PHY_J721E_WIZ
    CONFIG_PHY_TI_GMII_SEL

Supported Modes
"""""""""""""""

Currently, the following modes are supported in the SDK with the native ethernet driver:

+-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

+-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

.. note::
    For enabling native ethernet, the am65-cpsw-nuss driver has to be included in the
    kernel build. The native ethernet features are enabled by applying device-tree
    overlays at U-Boot.

For RGMII mode, the GESI expansion card's overlay may be used.
For QSGMII mode, the Quad Port Ethernet Expander daughter card's overlay may be used.
While SGMII mode has been verified in the SoC's which mention SGMII mode, no overlay is
provided with the SDK.

MAC Mode
""""""""

All the features documented within the "MAC mode" section of :ref:`cpsw2g` are applicable
to CPSWng Native Ethernet as well. The steps documented in that section can be followed
for utilizing the MAC mode features.

Switch Mode
"""""""""""

All the SoCs listed above support Switch Mode when configured in QSGMII mode.

The Switch mode can be enabled by configuring devlink driver parameter
"switch_mode" to 1/true::

        devlink dev param set platform/c000000.ethernet \
        name switch_mode value true cmode runtime

Above setting can be done regardless of the state of Port's netdev
devices - UP/DOWN, but Port's netdev devices have to be in UP state
before joining the bridge. This is to avoid overwriting of bridge
configuration as CPSW switch driver completely reloads its configuration
when first port changes its state to UP.

When all the interfaces have joined the bridge - CPSW switch driver will
enable marking packets with offload_fwd_mark flag.

All configuration is implemented via switchdev API.

Bridge setup
''''''''''''

::

    devlink dev param set platform/c000000.ethernet \
    name switch_mode value true cmode runtime

    ip link add name br0 type bridge
    ip link set dev br0 type bridge ageing_time 1000
    ip link set dev eth1 up
    ip link set dev eth2 up
    ip link set dev eth3 up
    ip link set dev eth4 up
    ip link set dev eth1 master br0
    ip link set dev eth2 master br0
    ip link set dev eth3 master br0
    ip link set dev eth4 master br0

    [*] ip link set dev br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1

    [*] bridge vlan add dev br0 vid 1 pvid untagged self

    Note: Steps [*] are mandatory.

.. Caution::

   Multicast flooding is on by default when Switch Mode is enabled.

Turn On/Off Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

::

    ip link set dev br0 type bridge stp_state 1/0

VLAN configuration
''''''''''''''''''

::

    bridge vlan add dev br0 vid 1 pvid untagged self <---- add cpu port to VLAN 1

This step is mandatory for bridge/default_pvid.

Adding extra VLANs
''''''''''''''''''

1. Untagged

::

    bridge vlan add dev eth1 vid 100 pvid untagged master
    bridge vlan add dev sw0p2 vid 100 pvid untagged master
    bridge vlan add dev br0 vid 100 pvid untagged self <---- Add cpu port to VLAN100

2. Tagged

::

    bridge vlan add dev eth1 vid 100 master
    bridge vlan add dev sw0p2 vid 100 master
    bridge vlan add dev br0 vid 100 pvid tagged self <---- Add cpu port to VLAN100

Forwarding Data Bases (FDBs)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Forwarding entries for MAC addresses are automatically added on the
appropriate switch port upon detection as default operation as an
unmanaged bridge. For managed bridge operation manually add FDB entries
as required.

Manually adding FDBs::

    bridge fdb add aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff dev eth1 master vlan 100
    bridge fdb add aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:fe dev sw0p2 master <---- Add on all VLANs

Multicast Data Bases (MDBs)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Multicast entries are automatically added on the appropriate switch port
upon detection as default operation as an unmanaged bridge. For managed
bridge operation manually add MDB entries as required.

Manually adding MDBs::

  bridge mdb add dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.1.1.1 permanent vid 100
  bridge mdb add dev br0 port eth1 grp 239.1.1.1 permanent <---- Add on all VLANs

Multicast flooding
''''''''''''''''''

CPU port mcast_flooding is always on

Turning flooding on/off on switch ports::

  bridge link set dev eth1 mcast_flood on/off

TSN Features
""""""""""""

The TSN features supported by CPSWng Native Ethernet along with the testing details are documented
at :ref:`tsn_with_cpsw`. The steps documented in that page can be followed with appropriate
modifications.
