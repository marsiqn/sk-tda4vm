Introduction
************

The USB subsystem has a SuperSpeed (SS) USB3.1 Gen1 Dual-Role-Device (DRD)
controller with on-chip SS (USB3.1 Gen1) PHY and HS/FS/LS (USB2.0) PHY.

.. note::
    LowSpeed (LS) is only supported in host mode.

TI SoC Integration
******************

The USB subsystem is integrated in TI |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| devices.

EVM
***

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family')

    The following diagram depicts USB integration in J721E EVM.

    .. image:: /images/usb_j721e_evm.png

    USB0 controller operates in super-speed dual role mode and is available on
    a Type-C connector.

    .. note::
       The Type-C config DIP switch (SW3) must be set for DRP (Dual-role-Port)
       operation. SW3.3 = OFF, SW3.4 = ON.

    USB1 operates in high-speed host mode and is connected to an onboard 4-port
    HUB.  Of the 4 hub ports, 2 ports are available on stacked Type-A connectors,
    1 is available on J2 header for USB-WiFi/Bluetooth adapter and 1 is available
    on the **EVM EXPANSION** connector J51.

    USB2 controller is not present on J721E SoC so micro-AB 3.0 connector is not
    usable.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('AM64X_family')

   The USB controller operates in USB2.0 dual role mode on |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__|
   EVM with a microAB receptacle (labeled as J24).

   A 2x3 header (labeled as J23) is provided on |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__|
   EVM to configure the port for host-only mode. Connecting Pin 1 and 2 to enable
   bulk capacitance on VBUS, and connecting Pin 5 and 6 to ground the ID pin.
