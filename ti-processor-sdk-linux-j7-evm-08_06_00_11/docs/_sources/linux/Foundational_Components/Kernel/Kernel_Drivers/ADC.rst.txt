ADC
---------------------------------

.. rubric:: **Introduction**
   :name: introduction-core-adc

An analog-to-digital converter (abbreviated ADC) is a device that uses
sampling to convert a continuous quantity to a discrete time
representation in digital form.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant not in ('AM64X', 'AM65X')

   The TSC\_ADC\_SS (Touchscreen\_ADC\_subsystem) is an 8 channel general
   purpose ADC, with optional support for interleaving Touch Screen
   conversions. The TSC\_ADC\_SS can be used and configured in one of the
   following application options:

   -  8 general purpose ADC channels
   -  4 wire TS, with 4 general purpose ADC channels
   -  5 wire TS, with 3 general purpose ADC channels

   ADC used is 12 bit SAR ADC with a sample rate of 200 KSPS (Kilo Samples
   Per Second). The ADC samples the analog signal when "start of
   conversion" signal is high and continues sampling 1 clock cycle after
   the falling edge. It captures the signal at the end of sampling period
   and starts conversion. It uses 12 clock cycles to digitize the sampled
   input; then an "end of conversion" signal is enabled high indicating
   that the digital data ADCOUT<11:0> is ready for SW to consume. A new
   conversion cycle can be initiated after the previous data is read.
   Please note that the ADC output is positive binary weighted data.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM64X', 'AM65X')

   The ADC is a 12-bit, 8-channel, general purpose ADC with a sample rate
   of 4 MSPS (Megasamples per second or millions of samples per second).
   The ADC sits idle until a Start of Conversion (SOC) pulse allows the
   it to start conversion. The ADC samples the analog signal when "start
   of conversion" signal is high and continues sampling 1 clock cycle after
   the falling edge. It captures the signal at the end of sampling period
   and starts conversion. It uses 13 clock cycles to digitize the sampled
   input; then an "end of conversion" signal is enabled high indicating
   that the digital data ADCOUT<11:0> is ready for SW to consume. A new
   conversion cycle can be initiated after the previous data is read.
   Please note that the ADC output is positive binary weighted data.

.. rubric:: **Convert Analog voltage to Digital**
   :name: convert-analog-voltage-to-digital

To cross verify the digital values read use,

::

    D = Vin * (2^n - 1) / Vref

::

    Where:
    D = Digital value
    Vin = Input voltage
    n = No of bits
    Vref = reference voltage

Ex: Read value on channel AIN4 for input voltage supplied 1.01:

Formula:

::

    D = 1.01 * (2^12 -1 )/ 1.8
    D = 2297.75

.. rubric:: **Modes of operation**
   :name: modes-of-operation

When the ADC sequencer finishes cycling through all the enabled
channels, the user can decide if the sequencer should stop (one-shot
mode), or loop back and schedule again (continuous mode). If one-shot
mode is enabled, then the sequencer will only be scheduled one time (the
sequencer HW will automatically disable the StepEnable bit after it is
scheduled which will guarantee only one sample is taken per channel).
When the user wants to continuously take samples, continuous mode needs
to be enabled. One cannot read ADC data from one channel operating in
One-shot mode and and other in continuous mode at the same time.

.. rubric:: **One-shot Mode**
   :name: one-shot-mode

To read a single ADC output from a particular channel this interface can
be used.

Where:

-  u is the sign of the value returned. It could be either u (for
   unsigned) or s (for signed)
-  12 is the number of relevant bits of information
-  16 is the actual number of bits used to store the datum
-  0 is the number of right shifts needed.

.. rubric:: **How to set it up**
   :name: how-to-set-it-up

To read ADC data continuously we need to enable buffer and channels to
be used.

Set up the channels in use (you can enable any combination of the
channels you want)

::

    root@arago-armv7:~# echo 1 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/scan_elements/in_voltage0_en
    root@arago-armv7:~# echo 1 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/scan_elements/in_voltage5_en
    root@arago-armv7:~# echo 1 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/scan_elements/in_voltage7_en

Set up the buffer length

::

    root@arago-armv7:~# echo 100 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/buffer/length

Enable the capture

::

    root@arago-armv7:~# echo 1 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/buffer/enable

| Now, all the captures are exposed in the character device
  ``/dev/iio:device0``

To stop the capture, just disable the buffer

::

.. rubric:: **Userspace Sample Application**
   :name: userspace-sample-application

The source code is located under kernel sources at
``tools/iio/iio_generic_buffer.c``.

How to compile:

::

    $ make -C <kernel-src-dir>/tools/iio ARCH=arm

The ``iio_generic_buffer`` application does all the ADC channel "enable"
and "disable" actions for you. You will only need to specify the IIO
driver. Application takes *buffer length* to use (256 in this example)
and the *number of iterations* you want to run (3 in this example). By
just enabling the buffer ADC switches to continuous mode.

::

    root@charlie:~# ./iio_generic_buffer -?                          
    Usage: generic_buffer [options]...
    Capture, convert and output data from IIO device buffer
      -a         Auto-activate all available channels
      -A         Force-activate ALL channels
      -c <n>     Do n conversions
      -e         Disable wait for event (new data)
      -g         Use trigger-less mode
      -l <n>     Set buffer length to n samples
      --device-name -n <name>
      --device-num -N <num>
            Set device by name or number (mandatory)

      --trigger-num -T <num>
            Set trigger by name or number
      -w <n>     Set delay between reads in us (event-less mode)

For example:-

::

    iio device number being used is 0
    trigger-less mode selected
