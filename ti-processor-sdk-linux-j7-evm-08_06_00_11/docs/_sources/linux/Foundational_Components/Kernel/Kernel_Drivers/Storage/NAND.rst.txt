.. rubric::  **TI infrastructure for NAND Flash devices**
   :name: ti-infrastructure-for-nand-flash-devices

TI's SoC interface with NAND Flash devices via on-chip GPMC (General
Purpose Memory Controller) interface or via AEMIF depending on the SoC.

For devices that include GPMC: The ECC algorithms required by NAND
devices to protect their data, are managed by two independent hardware
engines:

-  GPMC ECC engine: used for calculating ECC checksum while writing and
   reading the NAND device.
-  ELM ECC engine: used for locating and decoding ECC errors while
   reading the NAND device.

Depending on the SoC, a different set of NAND IP and drivers might be in use. The
following table summarizes the NAND IP and drivers used for each SoC family.

.. rubric:: Accessing NAND partitions
   :name: accessing-nand-partitions

.. rubric:: Linux
   :name: linux

In Linux, NAND partitions are accessed via mtd devices through the Linux
MTD subsystem. The mtd device names are named /dev/mtdX, where X is and integer.

    .. rubric:: Determine NAND Partition MTD Identifier
       :name: determine-nand-partition-mtd-identifier

    Within the kernel figuring out the mtd device number that is for a
    particular NAND partition is simple. A user simply needs to view the
    list of mtd devices along with its name. Below command will provide this
    information:

    ::

        cat /proc/mtd

    An example of this output performed on the DRA71x EVM can be seen below.

    ::

        dev:    size   erasesize  name
        mtd0: 00010000 00010000 "QSPI.SPL"

        mtd2: 00010000 00010000 "QSPI.SPL.backup2"
        mtd3: 00010000 00010000 "QSPI.SPL.backup3"
        mtd4: 00100000 00010000 "QSPI.u-boot"
        mtd5: 00080000 00010000 "QSPI.u-boot-spl-os"

        mtd8: 00800000 00010000 "QSPI.kernel"
        mtd9: 01620000 00010000 "QSPI.file-system"
        mtd10: 00020000 00020000 "NAND.SPL"
        mtd11: 00020000 00020000 "NAND.SPL.backup1"
        mtd12: 00020000 00020000 "NAND.SPL.backup2"
        mtd13: 00020000 00020000 "NAND.SPL.backup3"
        mtd14: 00040000 00020000 "NAND.u-boot-spl-os"
        mtd15: 00100000 00020000 "NAND.u-boot"
        mtd16: 00020000 00020000 "NAND.u-boot-env"
        mtd17: 00020000 00020000 "NAND.u-boot-env.backup1"
        mtd18: 00800000 00020000 "NAND.kernel"
        mtd19: 0f600000 00020000 "NAND.file-system"

    As you can see from the above list, mtd devices not only include NAND
    partitions but other MTD partitions as well (e.g. OSPI).
    e.g. if you want to access the NAND.file-system partition you need to use
    /dev/mtd19. Linux knows the partition names, offsets and sizes via the
    MTD partition entry specified in the boards device tree.

    .. rubric:: Erasing, Reading and Writing
       :name: erasing-reading-and-writing

    For the below sections it is important to remember to replace **mtdX**
    with the appropriate mtd device that is associated with the particular NAND
    partition that you want to use.

    | **Erasing**
    | Erasing a NAND partition can be performed by using the below command:

    ::

        flash_erase /dev/mtdX 0 0

    | **Writing**
    | Writing a NAND partition is usually a two step process. Writing to
      NAND at a bit level is only able to change a bit from 1 to 0. This is
      problematic since frequently when writing new data you will need to
      change many bits from 1 to 0 along with changing some bits from 0 to
      1. The only way to get around this is erasing the NAND partition
      before writing. This is because erasing sets all the bits in a
      partition to 1.

    | The command to write to a NAND partition is below:

    ::

        nandwrite -p /dev/mtdX <filename>

    | **Reading**
    | Reading NAND can be done by running the below command:

    ::

        nanddump /dev/mtdX -f <filename>

    **Note:** The above command by default will save the full partition
    contents to the file. If you are interested in only a certain
    amount of data, additional parameters can be passed to the nanddump
    utility.

.. rubric:: U-boot
   :name: u-boot

Information regarding NAND booting and booting the kernel and file
system from NAND can be found in the U-boot User Guide NAND
section.


.. rubric:: **NAND Based File system**
   :name: nand-based-file-system

The bootloader and u-boot partitions don't use any filesystem. The
images are flased directly to NAND flash.

The Filesystem though uses UBIFS filesystem. NAND flash is prone to
bit-flips. UBI + UBIFS takes care of the bit-flips issue and as well as
many other things like wear leveling, bad-block management, etc.

    .. rubric:: Required Software for UBI image creation
       :name: required-software-ubifs

    Building a UBI file system requires two applications, ubinize and
    mkfs.ubifs. Both are both provided by mtd-utils package.
    (sudo apt-get install mtd-utils).

    .. rubric:: Building a UBI File system image
       :name: building-ubi-file-system

    When building a UBI file system you need to have a directory that
    contains the exact files and directories layout that you plan to use for
    your file system. This is similar to the files and directories layout
    you will use to copy a file system onto a SD card for booting purposes.
    It is important that your file system size is smaller than the file
    system partition in the NAND.

    Next you need a file named ubinize.cfg. Below contains the exact
    contents of ubinize.cfg you should use. However, replace **<name>**
    with a name of your choosing. e.g. rootfs

    ubinize.cfg contents:

    ::

        [ubifs]
         mode=ubi
         image=<name>.ubifs
         vol_id=0
         vol_type=dynamic
         vol_name=rootfs
         vol_flags=autoresize

    To build a UBI files system requires the below two commands. The
    symbol **<directory path>** should be replaced with the path to
    your directory that you want to include into a ubifs. The symbol
    <name> should be replaced with the same value you used in creating
    ubinize.cfg. Make sure you use the same value of <name> across the two
    commands and ubinize.cfg. The symbols **<MKUBIFS ARGS>** and
    **<UBINIZE ARGS>** are board specific. Replace these values with the
    values seen in the below table based on the TI EVM you are using.

    Commands to execute:

    ::

        ~# mkfs.ubifs -r <directory path> -o <name>.ubifs <MKUBIFS ARGS>
        ~# ubinize -o <name>.ubi <UBINIZE ARGS> ubinize.cfg

    Once these commands are executed <name>.ubi can then be flashed into
    the NAND's file-system partition.

    .. rubric:: Flashing the UBI File system image to NAND
       :name: flashing-ubi-file-system

    Copy the UBI image created above to the EVM via SD card or Network.
    Use ubiformat from EVM Linux to flash the UBI filesystem to the NAND file-system
    partition.

    ::

        ~# ubiformat -f rootfs.ubi /dev/mtd<X>

    Alternatively, you can use u-boot to download and flash the UBI image
    to the NAND flash over USB in DFU mode (Not Supported in AM64 in 8.2).

   :name: dra74x-evm

On the board, NAND Flash signals are muxed between NAND, NOR and Video
Out signals. Therefore, to have the signals properly muxed for NAND to
work Pin 1 (first pin on the left) must be turned on and Pin 2 must be
turned off. Pin 1 and 2 must never be switched on at the same time.
Doing so may cause damage to the board or SoC.

.. rubric:: AM64 GP EVM

NAND flash is not present on the EVM but needs to be added via an Expansion
card (TDMS64DC02EVM) that plugs into the High Speed Expansion (HSE) port.

The NAND flash and SoC supports BCH16 ECC Scheme but the BootROM does not support
BCH16. So BCH8 ECC Scheme has been used on this board.

.. note::

	Aside from setting the correct bootmode (SYSBOOT[5:0]) for
	NAND boot, make sure that The Bus width (SYSBOOT[13]) and
	Muxed-device (SYSBOOT[12:11]) are set as given in the TRM.

.. rubric:: Transfer Modes
   :name: transfer-modes

.. rubric:: **Choose correct bus transfer mode**
   :name: choose-correct-bus-transfer-mode

The GPMC NAND driver support following different modes of transfers data
to external NAND device.

-  "prefetch-polled" Prefetch polled mode (default)
-  "polled" Polled mode, without prefetch
-  "prefetch-dma" Prefetch enabled DMA mode
-  "prefetch-irq" Prefetch enabled IRQ mode

Transfer mode can be configured in linux-kernel via DT binding
**<ti,nand-xfer-type>**

.. rubric:: **DMA vs Non DMA Mode (PIO Mode)**
   :name: dma-vs-non-dma-mode-pio-mode

| The NAND interface is a low speed interface when compared to the main
  CPU. This means for most CPU frequencies
| if the CPU is reading the NAND buffers via polling then its fully
  capable of reading the NAND at its maximum speed.
| Of course the trade off being that the CPU while polling the NAND is
  not capable of doing anything else thus significantly
| increasing the overall CPU load.

| DMA performs best when it can read large amount of data at a time.
  This is necessary since the overhead in setting up, executing and
  returning from a DMA request is not insignificant so to compensate its
  best for the DMA to read/write as much data as possible. This provides
  a dual purpose of significant reduction in CPU load for an operation
  and also high performance.

The current NAND subsystem within Linux currently deals with reading a
single page from the NAND at a time. Unfortunately, the page size is
small enough that the overhead for using the DMA (including Linux DMA
software stack) negatively impacts the performance. Based on nand
performance tests done in early 2016 using the DMA reduced NAND read and
write performance by 10-20% depending on SOC. However, cpu load when
using polling via the same NAND test were around 99%. When using DMA
mode the CPU load for reading was around 35%-54% and for writing was
around 15%-30% depending on SOC.

.. rubric:: **Performance optimizations on NAND**

.. rubric:: **Tweak NAND device signal timings**
   :name: tweak-nand-device-signal-timings

Much of the NAND throughput can be improved by matching GPMC signal
timings with NAND device present on the board. Although GPMC signal
timing configurations are not same as those given in NAND device
datasheets, but they can be easily derived based on details given in
GPMC Controller functional specification.

-  Details of GPMC Signal Timing configurations and how to use them can
   be found in TI's Processor TRM

Chapter *General Purpose Memory Controller*
Section *Signal Control*

-  In Linux, GPMC signal timing configurations are specified via DTB.

Refer kernel\_docs
$LINUX/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers/ti,gpmc.yaml

Some timing configurations like <gpmc,rd-cycle-ns>, <gpmc,wr-cycle-ns>
have larger impact on NAND throughput than others.
