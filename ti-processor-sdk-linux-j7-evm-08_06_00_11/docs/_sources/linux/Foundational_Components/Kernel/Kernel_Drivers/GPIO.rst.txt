.. rubric:: GPIO Driver Overview
   :name: gpio-driver-overview

The GPIO Driver enables the GPIO controllers available on the device.
The driver configures the GPIO hardware and interfaces and makes them
available to the sysfs interface for user space interaction or other
device drivers that need to access pins. For example, a MMC/SD driver
may need to read a GPIO as in input to determine if a card is present.
The H/W GPIO controllers available will vary by SoC and system
configuration.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family', 'General_family', 'AM335X_family', 'AM437X_family')

    .. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family')

        .. rubric:: J721E specifics

        J721E SoCs host DAVINCI GPIO IP.

    .. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('General_family')

        .. rubric:: AM65 specifics

        AM65 SoCs host DAVINCI GPIO IP.

    Current software supports banked GPIO interrupt only. 16 GPIOs form a bank.
    Each bank can produce an interrupt; this is done to save the number of interrupt
    lines reaching the CPU.
    CONFIG_GPIO_DAVINCI=y should be part of the defconfig.

.. rubric:: Overview
   :name: overview-gpio-driver

The GPIO controllers allow interaction with GPIO pins for input/output
and interrupt generation.

.. rubric:: User Layer
   :name: user-layer

The GPIO driver can be used via the sysfs interface in user space or by
other drivers that may need to access pins as either input/outputs or
interrupts. More information about this driver and GPIO usage in Linux
can be found in the kernel documentation:

-  GPIO Interface:
   Under Kernel directory Documentation/gpio/gpio.txt
-  GPIO Driver:
   Under Kernel directory Documentation/gpio/driver.txt

.. rubric:: sysfs
   :name: sysfs

The sysfs interface is for GPIO is located in the kernel at
/sys/class/gpio. More information about this interface can also be found
in the kernel sources:

-  GPIO sysfs:
   Under Kernel directory Documentation/gpio/sysfs.txt

For controlling LEDs and Buttons, the kernel has standard drivers,
"leds-gpio" and "gpio\_keys", respectively, that should be used instead
of GPIO directly.

.. rubric:: Consuming Drivers
   :name: consuming-drivers

The GPIO Driver can also be easily leveraged by other drivers to
"consume" a GPIO.

-  GPIO Consumer:
   Under Kernel directory Documentation/gpio/consumer.txt

For an example of a driver using a GPIO pin, examine this entry in a dts
file for how the MMC/SD interface could use a GPIO as a card detect pin
Under Kernel directory arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-bone-common.dtsi line 401

.. rubric:: Features
   :name: features

-  Access GPIO from user space as input or output
-  Leverage GPIO from another "consumer" driver

    .. rubric:: Power Management
       :name: power-management

    | GPIO pins to be used to wake the system from low-power sleep states
      must be configured as a wake source in the device tree. Verify
      low-power wake capability in the device Technical Reference Manual.
      Some devices map specific wake capabilities to each GPIO bank.

    | To configure a GPIO pin as a wake up source, setup a gpio-key instance
      in the device tree. This will associate a GPIO pin with wake up
      capability and an interrupt.

    | For example, look at the ``gpio_keys: volume_keys@0`` node in the
      device tree ``LINUX/arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-evm.dts`` as a reference.
      GPIO0\_31 is configured as a wake source below:

    `` @am33xx_pinmux { ``

    ::

         pinctrl-names = "default";
         pinctrl-0 = <&test_keys>;
         ...
         test_keys: test_keys {
           0x74 (PIN_INPUT_PULLDOWN | MUX_MODE7);  /* gpmc_wpn.gpio0_31 */
         };
         ...
         keys: test_keys@0 {
           compatible = "gpio-keys";
           #address-cells = <1>;
           #size-cells = <0>;
           autorepeat;
           test@0 {
             label = "J4-pin21";
             linux,code = <155>;
             gpios = <&gpio0 31 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
             gpio-key,wakeup;
           };
          };
         ...

    };
