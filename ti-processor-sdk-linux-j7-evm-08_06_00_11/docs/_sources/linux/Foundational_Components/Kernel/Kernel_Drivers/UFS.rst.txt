UFS
---------------------------------

.. rubric:: Introduction
   :name: introduction-linux-ufs

Universal Flash Storage (UFS) is high performance mass storage device
with a serial interface. Its primarily used as a high performance data
storage device for embedded applications. There are JEDEC standards
governing UFS device and host controller. UFS adapts MIPI MPHY and
MIPI UniPro standards.

This user guide applies to kernel v4.19 and higher.

.. rubric:: Hardware Architecture and Software Architecure
   :name: hardware-architecture-ufs

UFS follows SCSI Architecture Model (SAM) and hence falls unders Linux's
SCSI stack. User space programs can interact with UFS storage device in
the same way as any other SCSI devices.
Hardware architecture is explained in detail in UFS JEDEC specification
JESD220D
Host Controller Interface and programming sequence is explained in
UFSHCI JEDEC specification JESD223C

UFS storage devices are exposed in Linux as /dev/sdX. Tools such as
fdisk can be used to format and store data onto them similar to
traditional Hard Disks.

Here is the typical enumeration log of UFS devices

.. rubric:: UFS Logical Units
   :name: UFS Logical Units

UFS flash device is composed of memory blocks that are mapped to
different Logical Units (LUs). UFS device address space is organized in
several memory areas configurable by the user. In particular, such
memory areas are denoted as logical units and characterized by the fact
that they have independent logical addressable spaces starting from the
logical address zero. Thus, a logical unit (LU) is an externally
addressable, independent, processing entity that processes SCSI tasks
(commands) and performs task management functions. Each logical unit is
independent of other logical units in a device

In addition to the logical units, the UFS device supports the following well known logical units for specific purposes: UFS Device, REPORT LUNS, Boot and RPMB. Logical units are addressed by the LUN (logical unit number), while well known logical unit are addressed by the W-LUN (well known logical unit number).
In particular, the UFS device shall support:
The number of logical units specified by bMaxNumberLU. Each of them configurable as boot logical units with a maximum of two.
One RPMB well known logical unit (W-LUN = 44h, LUN field in UPIU = C4h). RPMB well known
logical unit may be further configured into up to four separate RPMB
regions (RPMB region 0 - RPMB region 3). Two logical units can be
configured as boot logical unit, with only one of them active and
readable through the Boot well known logical unit (W-LUN = 30h) for the
execution of the system boot (see UFS Boot section of JEDEC Spec). The
RPMB well known logical unit is accessed by authenticated operations by
a well defined security algorithm. The other logical units will be used
to fulfill other use cases.

.. rubric:: Logical Block Provisioning
   :name: Logical Block Provisioning

Logical Block Provisioning is the concept that describes the relationship between the logical block address space and the physical memory resources that supports the logical address space.

.. note::

 By default, Device comes with no LUs provisioned therefore device must
 be provisioned to be able to store anything in the device.

.. rubric:: Interacting with UFS device from userspace:
   :name: Interacting with UFS device from userspace

UFS and SCSI layer supports something called Block SCSI Generic (BSG)
Device which exposes SCSI device such as UFS as generic device to
Userspace. UFS flash can be accessed at /dev/bsg/ufs-bsg.

`ufs-tool <https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/ufs-tool>`_
(part of SDK) can be used to interact with UFS device from userspace:

.. rubric:: UFS descriptors

A Descriptor is a block or page of parameters that describe something about a Device. For example, there are Device Descriptors, Configuration Descriptors, Unit Descriptors, etc.
In general, all Descriptors are readable, some may be write once, others
may have a write protection mechanism. The Configuration Descriptor is
writeable and allows modification of the device configuration set by the
manufacturer. More details in JEDEC UFS specification.
ufs-tool can be used to read any of the descriptor. See tool help for
more details.

.. rubric:: Provisioning UFS device using ufs-tool

UFS device can be provisioned by writing configuration descriptor to the
flash. You can read current configuration of UFS device using:

	Config Descriptor was written into config_desc_data_ind_0 file

This also dumps descriptor in binary format into file called
*config_desc_data_ind_0*. Edit file as necessary and write file back to
device using:

::

	ufs-tool desc -t 1 -w config_desc_data_ind_0 -p /dev/bsg/ufs-bsg

.. note::

 This erases all existing data on flash and creates new partition.
 There is a vendor specific limit on how many times device can be
 re-provisioned or re-partitioned. Also, this setup is non-volatile and
 persists across Power-On-Resets and needs to be done only once.

For J721E EVM, pre populated configuration descriptor binary file can be
found below. So, to provision UFS flash on J721e EVM:

- Download the :download:`file </files/config_desc_data_ind_0>`
- Execute below command to flash descriptor and reboot the board to see
  new partitions

::

	ufs-tool desc -t 1 -w config_desc_data_ind_0 -p /dev/bsg/ufs-bsg

This creates two LUs on device. A Boot LUN of 32MB and rest of the
flash (~32GB) is formated as general data area (for filesystem etc)
These two partitions appear as tow SCSI block devices eg /dev/sda and
/dev/sdb in Linux.
