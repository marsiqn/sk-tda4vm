PCIe Backplane
---------------------------------

.. rubric:: **Introduction**
   :name: introduction-linux-pcie-backplane

PCIe backplane allows multiple hosts with RC ports to communicate and share
data with each other.

.. Image:: /images/j7-linux-pcie-backplane.png

PCIe backplane is implemented using multiple instances of multi-function
endpoint controller. Each host should be connected to a separate endpoint
controller instance and each host will enumerate the other host as an
independent function.

PCIe uses NTB (non transparent bridge) for two hosts to communicate with each
other. Though J721E doesn't have an explicit NTB controller, NTB functionality
can be achieved using multiple endpoint controller instances. And for PCIe
backplane (to connect more than 2 hosts), aggregation of NTB controllers
can be modeled using multiple instances of multi-function endpoint controller.

In the below diagram, PCI NTB function configures the SoC with multiple
PCIe Endpoint (EP) instances in such a way that transaction from one EP
controller is routed to the other EP controller. Once PCI NTB function
configures the SoC with multiple EP instances, HOST1 and HOST2 can
communicate with each other using SoC as a bridge.

The SW architecture for NTB both on the host side and EP side is given
below. The top half is the host side NTB architecture, and the bottom half is
the endpoint side NTB architecture.

The following picture shows J721E EVM connected to two DRA7 EVMs. Here the two
DRA7x boards communicate with each other using J721E as backplane.

.. rubric:: *Backplane DTS Overlay File*
   :name: backplane-configuration

The following DTS overlay file configures the PCIe controller in EP mode and
also contains a device tree node to create a NTB function device:

::

  arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-j721e-pcie-backplane.dtso

In order to apply the dts overlay file, the following command should be given
in u-boot prompt:

::

  #setenv name_overlays k3-j721e-pcie-backplane.dtbo

.. rubric:: *EP Side Configuration (J721E Backplane)*
   :name: ep-side-configuration

.. rubric:: **Dip switch settings**

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J784S4')

  Both PCIe instances should be configured in EP mode by setting
  PCIE_1L_MODE_SEL (switch 5) and PCIE_2L_MODE_SEL (switch 6) in sw2 to '1'.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant not in ('J784S4')

  Both PCIe instances should be configured in EP mode by setting
  PCIE_1L_MODE_SEL (switch 5) and PCIE_2L_MODE_SEL (switch 6) in sw3 to '1'.

.. rubric:: **8.x SDK (5.10 Kernel)**

The following set of steps is required only for 5.10 Kernel

    .. rubric:: Creating pci-epf-ntb device

    PCI endpoint function device can be created using the configfs. To
    create pci-epf-ntb device, the following commands can be used:

    ::

        # mount -t configfs none /sys/kernel/config
        # cd /sys/kernel/config/pci_ep/
        # mkdir functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1

    The "mkdir func1" above creates the pci-epf-ntb function device that will
    be probed by pci_epf_ntb driver.

    The PCI endpoint framework populates the directory with the following
    configurable fields

    ::

        # ls functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1
        baseclass_code    deviceid          msi_interrupts    pci-epf-ntb.0
        progif_code       secondary         subsys_id         vendorid
        cache_line_size   interrupt_pin     msix_interrupts   primary
        revid             subclass_code     subsys_vendor_id

    The PCI endpoint function driver populates these entries with default values
    when the device is bound to the driver. The pci-epf-ntb driver populates
    vendorid with 0xffff and interrupt_pin with 0x0001

    ::

        # cat functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/vendorid
        0xffff
        # cat functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/interrupt_pin
        0x0001

    .. rubric:: Configuring pci-epf-ntb Device

    The user can configure the pci-epf-ntb device using its configfs entry. In order
    to change the vendorid and the deviceid, the following
    commands can be used

    ::

        # echo 0x104c > functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/vendorid
        # echo 0xb00d > functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/deviceid

    In order to configure NTB specific attributes, a new sub-directory to func1
    should be created

    ::

        # mkdir functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/pci_epf_ntb.0/

    The NTB function driver will populate this directory with various attributes
    that can be configured by the user

    ::

        # ls functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/pci_epf_ntb.0/
        db_count    mw1         mw2         mw3         mw4         num_mws
        spad_count

    A sample configuration for NTB function is given below

    ::

        # echo 4 > functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/pci_epf_ntb.0/db_count
        # echo 128 > functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/pci_epf_ntb.0/spad_count
        # echo 2 > functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/pci_epf_ntb.0/num_mws
        # echo 0x100000 > functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/pci_epf_ntb.0/mw1
        # echo 0x100000 > functions/pci_epf_ntb/func1/pci_epf_ntb.0/mw2


    .. rubric:: Binding pci-epf-ntb Device to EP Controller

    NTB function device should be attached to two PCI endpoint controllers
    connected to the two hosts. Use the 'primary' and 'secondary' entries
    inside NTB function device to attach one PCI endpoint controller to
    primary interface and the other PCI endpoint controller to the secondary
    interface

    ::

        # ln -s controllers/2900000.pcie-ep/ functions/pci-epf-ntb/func1/primary
        # ln -s controllers/2910000.pcie-ep/ functions/pci-epf-ntb/func1/secondary

    Once the above step is completed, both the PCI endpoint controllers are ready to
    establish a link with the host.

    .. rubric:: Start the Link: 7.x and 8.x SDK (5.4 and 5.10 Kernel)

    In order for the endpoint device to establish a link with the host, the _start_
    field should be populated with '1'. For NTB, both the PCI endpoint controllers
    should establish link with the host

    ::

        # echo 1 > controllers/2900000.pcie-ep/start
        # echo 1 > controllers/2910000.pcie-ep/start

(PCIe2 can also be configured for NTB, but that is not
tested yet).

.. rubric:: *RC Side Configuration*
   :name: rc-side-configuration

The hosts that have to communicate with each other can be bought up in any order
after EP has been brought up. Once the host boots up, the below steps have
to be done in each of the hosts.

Since the same vendor ID and device ID are used for multiple function drivers
(pci-endpoint-test and ntb_hw_epf), the device should be first ubound from
existing driver.

::

  echo 0000:01:00.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.0/driver/unbind

After unbinding from existing driver, it should be bound to ntb_hw_epf driver.

::

  echo 0000:01:00.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ntb_hw_epf/bind

Then bind one of the NTB application driver. Here ntb_netdev is bound to emulate
ethernet over PCIe. This will create a new ethernet interface for each of the
hosts.

::

  modprobe ntb_transport
  modprobe ntb_netdev
