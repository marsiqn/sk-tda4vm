.. rubric:: Features Not Supported
   :name: SPI-features-not-supported

Below contains a list of features not supported by the Linux driver.
Note this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list and only takes into
account features the SPI peripheral in the SoC is capable of but is
currently not supported in the Linux driver.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family', 'General_family', 'AM335X_family', 'AM437X_family')

   - SPI slave mode is supported only with DMA enabled.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family not in ('J7_family')

   - SPI slave mode isn't supported.

.. rubric:: Kernel Configuration

The specific peripheral driver to enable depends on the SoC being used.

drivers along with their documentation can be found within the kernel
sources. The below section attempts to provide information on SPI based
chips that are located on TI's evms.

**Determine SPI NOR Partition MTD Identifier**

Within the kernel figuring out the mtd device number that is for a
particular SPI NOR partition is simple. A user simply needs to view the
list of mtd devices along with its name. Below command will provide this
information:

.. code-block:: text

    cat /proc/mtd

An example of this output performed on the AM571x IDK EVM can be seen below.

.. code-block:: text

    dev:    size   erasesize  name
    mtd0: 00040000 00010000 "QSPI.SPL"
    mtd1: 00100000 00010000 "QSPI.u-boot"
    mtd2: 00080000 00010000 "QSPI.u-boot-spl-os"
    mtd3: 00010000 00010000 "QSPI.u-boot-env"
    mtd4: 00010000 00010000 "QSPI.u-boot-env.backup1"
    mtd5: 00800000 00010000 "QSPI.kernel"
    mtd6: 01620000 00010000 "QSPI.file-system"

Note the names of these partitions, their sizes (in hex) and offsets (in
hex) are determined within the specific board's device tree file.

**Erasing**

Erasing a NOR partition can be performed by using the below command:

.. code-block:: text

    flash_erase /dev/mtdX 0 0

Where X is the partition number.

**Reading/Writing**

Use the MTD interface provided for SPI flash on the EVM to validate
the SPI driver interface.

The below step copies 8KiB from /dev/mtd2 partition (u-boot env) to
/dev/mtd4 partition and reads the 8KiB image from /dev/mtd4 to a file
and checks the md5sum. The md5sum of test.img and test1.img should be same.

.. code-block:: text

    cd /tmp
    dd if=/dev/mtd2 of=test.img bs=8k count=1
    md5sum test.img
    flash_eraseall /dev/mtd4
    dd if=test.img of=/dev/mtd4 bs=8k count=1
    dd if=/dev/mtd4 of=test1.img bs=8k count=1
    md5sum test1.img

.. rubric:: Linux Userspace Interface
   :name: linux-userspace-interface

In situations where a premade SPI driver doesn't exist or a user wants a
simple means to send and receive SPI messages the spidev driver can be
used. Spidev provides a user space accessible means to communicate with
the SPI interface. Latest documentation regarding spidev driver can be
found
`here <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/spi/spidev>`__.

Spidev allows users to interact with the spi interface in a variety of
programming languages that can communicate with kernel ioctls.

.. rubric:: Kernel Configuration
   :name: kernel-configuration-2

.. code-block:: text

    Device Drivers  --->
       [*] SPI support
          <*> User mode SPI device driver support

.. rubric:: Device Tree

Below is an example of the device tree settings a user would use to
enable the spidev driver. Like most drivers for a peripheral, the spidev
driver is listed as a subnode of the main SPI peripheral driver.

.. code-block:: text

    &spi1 {
            status = "okay";
            pinctrl-names = "default";
            pinctrl-0 = <&spi1_pins_s0>;
            spidev@1 {
                    spi-max-frequency = <24000000>;
                    reg = <0>;
                    compatible = "rohm,dh2228fv";
            };
    };

-  Note that reg property for SPI subnodes are usually used to indicate
   the chip select to use when communicating with a particular driver.

.. rubric:: Test Application
   :name: test-application

In the kernel sources,
./tools/spi/\ `spidev\_test.c <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/spi/spidev_test.c>`__
is a test application within the kernel that can be cross compiled to
show a C application interacting with the SPI peripheral.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J721E', 'J7200', 'J721S2')

   .. rubric:: McSPI Master Slave Loopback

   In the Jacinto family of devices  MAIN_MCSPI4 instance is internally
   connected as slave to MCU_MCSPI2 master, a reference overlay is provided
   to demonstrate the MCSPI internal loopback for J7200, for other platforms
   the same overlay can be used with minor modifications to update for the PSIL
   thread id.Run the following commands in u-boot console to load the overlays:

   .. code-block:: text

    => setenv name_overlays k3-j7200-mcspi-loopback.dtbo
    => boot

   This will instantiate MAIN_MCSPI4 instance in slave mode and a spidev device
   on MCU_MCSPI2 master thus helping to test the loopback behavior from userspace.
   Note that the SPI Slave in Linux doesn't implement flow-control by default and
   custom flow control mechanism need to be implemented according to the application
   for deterministic performance.
