How to Setup a Samba Server
=======================================================
.. rubric:: Introduction
   :name: introduction-samba-server

When using a Virtual machine you may share files & folders via the
Share Foldr feature of that partoicular Virtual Machine.  Another
alternative, especially if you are using a dedicated Linux host, is to
configure a Samba server on your Linux host. 

Samba allows a host to interact with a Microsoft Windows client or
server as if it is a Windows file and print server. In other words, if
you are installing software on a Windows machine, you can easily
transfer/modify files to the host machine by accessing it (the host
machine) through windows.

during the install.

3. On Fedora install Samba with the yum command: system-config-samba

|     On Ubuntu install Samba using:  sudo apt-get install

   environment
-  Select "OK"

7. Add a user

-  From the toolbar, select Preferences -> Samba Users
-  Click "Add User"
-  From the "Unix Username" dropdown box, select the username you set up
-  In the "Windows Username" and password boxes, enter the Unix Username
   and password for that user, respectively.
-  Select "OK"

8. Turn off the firewall

-  System -> Administration -> Firewall
-  Select the "Disable" button

**NOTE - If you are within your company's firewall you may need to
configure the network proxy.**


9. Enable the Samba and NFS services


-  System -> Administration -> Services  (**NOTE - Not available in
   Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.  However the Samba service should start
   automatically**)
-  Enable the services by browsing through the list on the left and
   locating nfs and smb. If they are not already enabled, enable them by
   clicking the "Enable" button.

10. Test the configuration

-  From a terminal on the Linux workstation, type the command <prompt>
   **ifconfig** and note the IP address
-  From your Windows machine, go to Start -> Run and type \\\\<IP\_ADDR>
   replacing <IP\_ADDR> with the IP address of the Linux system
