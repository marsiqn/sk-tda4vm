  *./sys/v4l2/gstv4l2h264enc.c and ./sys/v4l2/gstv4l2h264enc.h*

   

  **Patch-2:** To be applied to Linux Kernel

  Patch file name:

  *0001-Added-H264-Profiles-Support-to-IMG-Video-encode-driv.patch*

  Location of Linux Kernel:

  *./ti-processor-sdk-linux-j7-evm-08_04_00_11/board-support/linux-5.10+gitAUTOINC+95b90aa828-g95b90aa828*

  Apply the patch from this folder and changes are made to the file:

  *./drivers/media/platform/vxe-vxd/encoder/vxe_v4l2.c*

  *./drivers/media/platform/vxe-vxd/encoder/vxe_enc.c*

  Once both the patches are applied, the driver can be verified by the below command. Use profile=0 for Base, profile=2 for Main, profile=4 for High. For any other value, default Base profile is set.
